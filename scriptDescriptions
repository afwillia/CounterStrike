So far we have:

1.consoleMunge.R-
  takes raw console data and turns it into df of time, killer, killed, and weapon
  clean.df is final output

2. cssRoundInfo.R-

  Also makes df for each player's kills by round
  out and round.df are final output and round.time is a vector of round endings.
  let's make a vector of round beginnings.
