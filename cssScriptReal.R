##### Part 1: Filter console data
#################################

#import console data
console.data <- readLines(con = "file.log")

#find rows with killing information. maybe add second grep for "with"
kill.data <- grep("killed", console.data, value=TRUE)
kill.data <- grep("with", kill.data, value=TRUE)

#until i decide to include timestamps or not...
#make separate df for timestamped kills
#filter out timestamp info, then combine with rest of data
kill.data.notime <- kill.data[1:122]
kill.data.ts <- kill.data[123:144]

#timestamp has 13 characters of date we can get rid of, 23 counting time.
#time is HH:MM:SS:   -- maybe filter out last colon?
#delete all time information for now... come back to it later

#based off above info, make function to extract last 24 to nchar()
#characters from string - removing the timestamp info.
#later if i want to include timestamp, make first cutoff 13

stringSplit <- function(x) {
  substring(x, 24, nchar(x))
}

kill.data.minus.ts <- lapply(kill.data.ts, stringSplit)

#combine non timestamp and timestamped data into one list
all.kill.data <- c(kill.data.minus.ts, kill.data.notime)
all.kill.data <- unlist(all.kill.data)

#split all lines by " killed " and " with ", so we get killer, killed,
# and weapon
data.list <- lapply(all.kill.data, 
                    function(x) strsplit(x, split = " killed | with "))

#this is a much better way of representing the data and tabling it.
df <- data.frame(matrix(unlist(data.list), 
                        nrow=length(data.list), byrow=T))
names(df) <- c("killer", "killed", "weapon")
